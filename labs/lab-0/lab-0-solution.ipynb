Python Objects and Classes\n","\n","* **THIS SECTION IS VERY IMPORTANT: READ CAREFULLY**\n","  <br />\n","* Understanding the concept of \"classes and objects\" is completely fundamental to understanding python. \n","  * This is because Python is an object oriented programming (OOP) language. \n","  * Which means that EVERYTHING in python is an object (of some python class).\n","  * We will not cover building python classes in detail during boot-camp (since it is an advanced topic). \n","<br /><br />\n","* However, we will introduce objects and classes here conceptually, because they are so fundamental. \n","* So what are classes and objects? \n","\n","* **Classes are \"blue prints\" or \"templates\" for building customizable data-structures**\n","  *  Think of them as \"customizable\" boxes that can;\n","     *  (1) store **data** in what are known as \"**attributes** of the class\" \n","         * These are comparable to how Dictionaries have keys and values\n","     *  (2) preform actions on themselves using **functions** which are known as \"**methods** of the class\".\n","  *  For example, if you wanted to build a custom data-structure to describe \"animals\" for a biology project.\n","     *  Then you could create a python class called \"animal\" to store information about the different animals in the study. \n","     *  This class would be a
