 Medieval origins 
In ancient times the Greeks cooked flat cakes called obelios between hot metal platesAs they were spread throughout medieval Europe the cake mix a mixture of flour water or milk and often eggs became known as wafers and were also cooked over an open fire between iron plates with long handlesWaffles are preceded in the early Middle Ages around the period of the  centuries with the simultaneous emergence of fer à hosties  hostieijzers communion wafer irons and moule à oublies wafer ironsWhile the communion wafer irons typically depicted imagery of Jesus and his crucifixion the moule à oublies featured more trivial Biblical scenes or simple emblematic designs",waffle,-0.4201
2,"The format of the iron itself was almost always round and considerably larger than those used for communionThe oublie was in its basic form composed only of grain flour and water  just as was the communion waferIt took until the  century as a product of The Crusades bringing new culinary ingredients to Western Europe for flavorings such as orange blossom water to be added to the oublies however locally sourced honey and other flavorings may have already been in use before that timeOublies not formally named as such until c  spread throughout northwestern continental Europe eventually leading to the formation of the oublieurs guild in  oublieursobloyers were responsible for not only producing the oublies but also for a number of other contemporaneous and subsequent pâtisseries légères light pastries including the waffles that were soon to arise  centuries 
In the late  century the first known waffle recipe was penned in an anonymous manuscript Le Ménagier de Paris written by a husband as a set of instructions to his young wifeWhile it technically contains four recipes all are a variation of the first Beat some eggs in a bowl season with salt and add wine",waffle,0.2732

4,However this was a waffle  gaufre in name only as the recipe contained no leaveningThough some have speculated that waffle irons first appeared in the  centuries it was not until the  century that a true physical distinction between the oublie and the waffle began to evolveNotably while a recipe like the fourth in Le Ménagier de Paris was only flour salt and wine  indistinguishable from common oublie recipes of the time  what did emerge was a new shape to many of the irons being producedNot only were the newly fashioned ones rectangular taking the form of the fer à hosties but some circular oublie irons were cut down to create rectanglesIt was also in this period that the waffles classic grid motif appeared clearly in a French fer à oublie and a Belgian wafelijzer   albeit in a more shallowly engraved fashion   setting the stage for the more deeply gridded irons that were about to become commonplace throughout Belgium,waffle,0.6808
5,By the  century paintings by Joachim de Beuckelaer Pieter Aertsen and Pieter Bruegel clearly depict the modern waffle formBruegels work in particular not only shows waffles being cooked but fine detail of individual wafflesIn those instances the waffle pattern can be counted as a large  grid with cleanly squared sides suggesting the use of a fairly thin batter akin to contemporary Brussels waffles Brusselse wafelsThe earliest of the  century waffle recipes Om ghode waffellen te backen   from the Dutch KANTL  manuscript c   is only the second known waffle recipe after the four variants described in Le Ménagier de ParisFor the first time partial measurements were given sugar was used and spices were added directly to the batter Take grated white breadTake with that the yolk of an egg and a spoonful of pot sugar or powdered sugar,waffle,0.4678

7,Groote Wafelen in its use of leavening was the genesis of contemporary waffles and validates the use of deeper irons wafelijzers depicted in the Beuckelaer and Bruegel paintings of the timeBy the  century there were signs of waffles mounting French popularityFrancois I king from  to  of whom it was said les aimait beacoup loved them a lot had a set of waffle irons cast in pure silverHis successor Charles IX enacted the first waffle legislation in  in response to a series of quarrels and fights that had been breaking out between the oublieursThey were required dêtre au moins à la distance de deux toises lun de lautre,waffle,0.6705
