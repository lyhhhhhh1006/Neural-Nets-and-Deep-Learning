# Lab-6.1: Chatbot: Streamlit and GPT3

**Submission:**
* You need to upload THREE documents to Canvas when you are done
  * (1) Your `.py` code used to create your chatbot 
  * (2) A PDF output of your `.py` code (makes grading easier)
  * (3) A screen-shot showing you using your web-application with an example input AND the GPT-3 chatbot-response
* The final uploaded version should NOT have any code-errors present 
* All outputs must be visible in the uploaded version, including code-cell outputs, images, graphs, etc

### Assignment: 

* Use a combination of (1) Streamlit (to handel user input and website creation) and (2) GPT3 to create a chatbot 
* See lecture slides for examples
* You don't have to go "deep" down the rabbit hole. A simple chatbot example is sufficient
