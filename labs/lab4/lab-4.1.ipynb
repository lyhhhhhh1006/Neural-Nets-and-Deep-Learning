    "THE BOY WHO LIVED \n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, \n",
    "were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, \n",
    "thank you very much. They were the last people you’d \n",
    "expect to be involved in anything strange or \n",
    "mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such \n",
    "nonsense. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called \n",
    "Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy \n",
    "man with hardly any neck, although he did have a \n",
    "very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and \n",
    "blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of \n",
    "neck, which came in very useful as she spent so \n",
    "much of her time craning over garden fences, spying \n",
    "on the neighbors. The Dursley s had a small son \n",
    "called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer \n",
    "boy anywhere. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they \n",
    "also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that \n",
    "somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they \n",
    "could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. \n",
    "Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t \n",
    "\n",
    "Page | 2 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended \n",
    "she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her \n",
    "good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it \n",
    "was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think \n",
    "what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in \n",
    "the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a \n",
    "small son, too, but they had never even seen him. \n",
    "\n",
    "This boy was another good reason for keeping the \n",
    "Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a \n",
    "child like that. \n",
    "\n",
    "When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray \n",
    "Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the \n",
    "cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and \n",
    "mysterious things would soon be happening all over \n",
    "the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out \n",
    "his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley \n",
    "gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming \n",
    "Dudley into his high chair. \n",
    "\n",
    "None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past \n",
    "the window. \n",
    "\n",
    "At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his \n",
    "briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and \n",
    "tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because \n",
    "Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his \n",
    "cereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley \n",
    "as he left the house. He got into his car and backed \n",
    "out of number four’s drive. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the \n",
    "first sign of something peculiar — a cat reading a \n",
    "map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what he \n",
    "had seen — then he jerked his head around to look \n",
    "again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner \n",
    "of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What \n",
    "could he have been thinking of? It must have been a \n",
    "trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at \n",
    "Page | 3 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around \n",
    "the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his \n",
    "mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet \n",
    "Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read \n",
    "maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake \n",
    "and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward \n",
    "town he thought of nothing except a large order of \n",
    "drills he was hoping to get that day. \n",
    "\n",
    "But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his \n",
    "mind by something else. As he sat in the usual \n",
    "morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that \n",
    "there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people \n",
    "about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear \n",
    "people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups \n",
    "you saw on young people! He supposed this was some \n",
    "stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the \n",
    "steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these \n",
    "weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering \n",
    "excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see \n",
    "that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that \n",
    "man had to be older than he was, and wearing an \n",
    "emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it \n",
    "struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly \n",
    "stunt — these people were obviously collecting for \n",
    "something ... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved \n",
    "on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the \n",
    "Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in \n",
    "his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might \n",
    "have found it harder to concentrate on drills that \n",
    "morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in \n",
    "broad daylight, though people down in the street did; \n",
    "they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after \n",
    "owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an \n",
    "owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a \n",
    "perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five \n",
    "different people. He made several important telephone \n",
    "Page | 4 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good \n",
    "mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch \n",
    "his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a \n",
    "bun from the bakery. \n",
    "\n",
    "He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he \n",
    "passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed \n",
    "them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but \n",
    "they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering \n",
    "excitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single collecting \n",
    "tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a \n",
    "large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words \n",
    "of what they were saying. \n",
    "\n",
    "“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard — ” \n",
    "\n",
    "“ — yes, their son, Harry — ” \n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He \n",
    "looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say \n",
    "something to them, but thought better of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his \n",
    "office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, \n",
    "seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing \n",
    "his home number when he changed his mind. He put \n",
    "the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, \n",
    "thinking ... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn’t \n",
    "such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots \n",
    "of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. \n",
    "Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew \n",
    "was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It \n",
    "might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no \n",
    "point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so \n",
    "upset at any mention of her sister. He didn’t blame \n",
    "her — if he’d had a sister like that ... but all the \n",
    "same, those people in cloaks ... \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Page | 5 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that \n",
    "afternoon and when he left the building at five o’clock, \n",
    "he was still so worried that he walked straight into \n",
    "someone just outside the door. \n",
    "\n",
    "“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled \n",
    "and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. \n",
    "Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet \n",
    "cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost \n",
    "knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split \n",
    "into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that \n",
    "made passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, \n",
    "for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You- \n",
    "Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like \n",
    "yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy \n",
    "day!” \n",
    "\n",
    "And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the \n",
    "middle and walked off. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been \n",
    "hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he \n",
    "had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was \n",
    "rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, \n",
    "hoping he was imagining things, which he had never \n",
    "hoped before, because he didn’t approve of \n",
    "imagination. \n",
    "\n",
    "As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the \n",
    "first thing he saw — and it didn’t improve his mood — \n",
    "was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It was \n",
    "now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the \n",
    "same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. \n",
    "\n",
    "“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. \n",
    "\n",
    "Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. \n",
    "Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the \n",
    "\n",
    "Page | 6 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "house. He was still determined not to mention \n",
    "anything to his wife. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told \n",
    "him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems \n",
    "with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new \n",
    "word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. \n",
    "When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the \n",
    "living room in time to catch the last report on the \n",
    "evening news: \n",
    "\n",
    "“And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported \n",
    "that the nation’s owls have been behaving very \n",
    "unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at \n",
    "night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have \n",
    "been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in \n",
    "every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to \n",
    "explain why the owls have suddenly changed their \n",
    "sleeping pattern.” The newscaster allowed himself a \n",
    "grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim \n",
    "McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more \n",
    "showers of owls tonight, Jim?” \n",
    "\n",
    "“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about \n",
    "that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting \n",
    "oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, \n",
    "and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that \n",
    "instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a \n",
    "downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have \n",
    "been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until \n",
    "next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night \n",
    "tonight.” \n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars \n",
    "all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious \n",
    "people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a \n",
    "whisper about the Potters . . . \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two \n",
    "cups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say \n",
    "something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er \n",
    "— Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister \n",
    "lately, have you?” \n",
    "\n",
    "As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and \n",
    "angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t \n",
    "have a sister. \n",
    "\n",
    "“No,” she said sharply. “Why?” \n",
    "\n",
    "“Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. \n",
    "“Owls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of \n",
    "funny-looking people in town today ...” \n",
    "\n",
    "“So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley. \n",
    "\n",
    "“Well, I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to \n",
    "do with ... you know ... her crowd.” \n",
    "\n",
    "Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. \n",
    "Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he’d \n",
    "heard the name “Potter.” He decided he didn’t dare. \n",
    "Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son — \n",
    "he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?” \n",
    "\n",
    "“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. \n",
    "\n",
    "“What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?” \n",
    "\n",
    "“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.” \n",
    "\n",
    "“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking \n",
    "horribly. “Yes, I quite agree.” \n",
    "\n",
    "He didn’t say another word on the subject as they \n",
    "went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the \n",
    "bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window \n",
    "\n",
    "Page | 8 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "and peered down into the front garden. The cat was \n",
    "still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though \n",
    "it were waiting for something. \n",
    "\n",
    "Was he imagining things? Could all this have \n",
    "anything to do with the Potters? If it did ... if it got out \n",
    "that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn’t \n",
    "think he could bear it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep \n",
    "quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over \n",
    "in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell \n",
    "asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, \n",
    "there was no reason for them to come near him and \n",
    "Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and \n",
    "Petunia thought about them and their kind. ... He \n",
    "couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up \n",
    "in anything that might be going on — he yawned and \n",
    "turned over — it couldn’t affect them. ... \n",
    "\n",
    "How very wrong he was. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy \n",
    "sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no \n",
    "sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, \n",
    "its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet \n",
    "Drive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door \n",
    "slammed on the next street, nor when two owls \n",
    "swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight \n",
    "before the cat moved at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "A man appeared on the corner the cat had been \n",
    "watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d \n",
    "have thought he’d just popped out of the ground. The \n",
    "cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet \n",
    "Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the \n",
    "silver of his hair and beard, which were both long \n",
    "\n",
    "Page | 9 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long \n",
    "robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and \n",
    "high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, \n",
    "bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles \n",
    "and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it \n",
    "had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was \n",
    "Albus Dumbledore. \n",
    "\n",
    "Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had \n",
    "just arrived in a street where everything from his \n",
    "name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy \n",
    "rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But \n",
    "he did seem to realize he was being watched, because \n",
    "he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still \n",
    "staring at him from the other end of the street. For \n",
    "some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse \n",
    "him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have \n",
    "known.” \n",
    "\n",
    "He found what he was looking for in his inside \n",
    "pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He \n",
    "flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. \n",
    "The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He \n",
    "clicked it again — the next lamp flickered into \n",
    "darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, \n",
    "until the only lights left on the whole street were two \n",
    "tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of \n",
    "the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their \n",
    "window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they \n",
    "wouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening \n",
    "down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put- \n",
    "Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the \n",
    "street toward number four, where he sat down on the \n",
    "wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a \n",
    "moment he spoke to it. \n",

    "“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.” \n",

    "Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking \n",
    "woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the \n",
    "shape of the markings the cat had had around its \n",
    "eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. \n",
    "Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She \n",
    "looked distinctly ruffled. \n",
    "\n",
    "“How did you know it was me?” she asked. \n",
    "\n",
    "“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.” \n",
    "\n",
    "“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all \n",
    "day,” said Professor McGonagall. \n",
    "\n",
    "“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I \n",
    "must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my \n",
    "way here.” \n",
    "\n",
    "Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. \n",
    "\n",
    "“Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,” she said \n",
    "impatiently. “You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, \n",
    "but no — even the Muggles have noticed something’s \n",
    "going on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head \n",
    "back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I \n",
    "heard it. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars. ... Well, \n",
    "they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to \n",
