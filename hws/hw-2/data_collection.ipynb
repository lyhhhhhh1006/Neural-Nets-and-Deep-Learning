    "# HW-2: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Classification and regression are some of the most common forms of supervised machine learning \n",
    "* In this homework we will explore regression and multi-class classification, as applied to text data\n",
    "* I would recommend starting the data collection and prep ASAP. Then doing the Neural network training after you have completed the labs.\n",
    "* Once the data is collected, this HW should be quite easy, since most of the code can be recycled from the labs and textbook. \n",
    "* **You can do this assignment in either Keras OR Pytorch. It is your choice.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions** \n",
    "* **Develope a text based classification and regression data-set:**\n",
    "  * Use the wikipedia API to search for articles to generate the data-set\n",
    "  * Select a set of highly different topics (i.e. labels), for example, \n",
    "    * multi-class case: y=(pizza, oak_trees, joe_biden, ... , etc)=(0,1,2, ... , N-1)\n",
    "    * You don't have to use these, you can use whatever labels you want but use at least 3 labels.  \n",
    "  * Search for wikipedia pages about these topics and harvest the text from the pages. \n",
    "  * Do some basic text cleaning as needed. \n",
    "  * Use the NLTK sentence tokenizer to break the text into sentences. Then form chunks of text that are five sentences long as your \"inputs\".\n",
    "  * The \"label\" for these chunks will be the search label used to find the text. \n",
    "  * Also \"tag\" each chunk of text with an associated \"compound\" sentiment score computed using NLTK sentiment analysis.\n",
    "  * The data set will not be perfect. \n",
    "    * There will be chunks of text that are not related to the topic (i.e. noise). \n",
    "    * However that is just something we have to live with.\n",
    "  * Important: Start small when writing and debugging THEN scale up. The more chunks of text you have the better.\n",
    "  * Do this in a file called \"data_collection.ipynb\", have it save its results to a folder \"data\"\n",
    "    * Save the text and labels to the same format used by the textbook, that way you can recycle your lab code seamlessly. \n",
    "    * Also, include a second file with the associated numeric sentiment scores.\n",
    "* **Training guide-lines**\n",
    "  * Do the training in this \"HW-2.ipynb\" file\n",
    "  * Use a dense feed forward ANN model\n",
    "  * Normalize the data as needed\n",
    "  * Visualize the results at the end where possible\n",
    "  * Partition data into training, validation, and test\n",
    "  * Monitor training and validation throughout training by plotting\n",
    "  * Print training, validation, and test errors at the very end\n",
    "  * Do basic hyper parameter tuning to try to achieve an optimal fit model\n",
    "    * i.e. best training/validation loss without over-fitting\n",
    "    * Explore L1 and L2 regularization (or dropout)\n",
    "    * Explore different optimizers \n",
    "    * Use the loss functions specified in the textbook\n",
    "    * Explore different options for activation functions, network size/depth, etc\n",
    "  * **Document what is going on in the code, as needed, with narrative markdown text between cells.**\n",
    "  * *Submit the version with hyper parameters that provide the optimal fit*\n",
    "    * i.e. you don't need to show the outputs of your hyper-parameter tuning process\n",
    "  * *Optional*: write an outer loop to do an automated hyperparameter search.\n",
    "* **Classification training:**\n",
    "  * Recycle your code from lab-2.2 to train a multi-class classifier on the data set \n",
    "* **Regression training:**\n",
    "  * Use your lab-2.1 code as a starting point \n",
    "  * Train a ANN to predict the sentiment score from the vectorized text\n",
    "    * Use the same input matrix as the classification problem\n",
    "    * This is a bit of a silly and circular exercise, since we are using the outputs of the NLTK model to train an ANN model.\n",
    "    * The only time you would want to do this is if the second model is computationally MUCH MUCH faster than the first.\n",
    "    * That being said, it is an educational exercise so hopefully it is informative.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Submission:**\n",
    "* You need to upload TWO documents to Canvas when you are done\n",
    "  * (1) A PDF (or HTML) of the completed form of the \"HW-2.ipynb\" document \n",
    "  * (2) A PDF (or HTML) of the completed form of the \"data_collection.ipynb\" document \n",
    "* The final uploaded version should NOT have any code-errors present \n",
    "* All outputs must be visible in the uploaded version, including code-cell outputs, images, graphs, etc\n",
    "* **Total points:** 41.66\n"
