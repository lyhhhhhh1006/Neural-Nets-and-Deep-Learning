    "* Understanding the concept of \"classes and objects\" is completely fundamental to understanding python. \n",
    "  * This is because Python is an object oriented programming (OOP) language. \n",
    "  * Which means that EVERYTHING in python is an object (of some python class).\n",
    "  * We will not cover building python classes in detail during boot-camp (since it is an advanced topic). \n",

    "* However, we will introduce objects and classes here conceptually, because they are so fundamental. \n",
    "* So what are classes and objects? \n",

    "* **Classes are \"blue prints\" or \"templates\" for building customizable data-structures**\n",
    "  *  Think of them as \"customizable\" boxes that can;\n",
    "     *  (1) store **data** in what are known as \"**attributes** of the class\" \n",
    "         * These are comparable to how Dictionaries have keys and values\n",
    "     *  (2) preform actions on themselves using **functions** which are known as \"**methods** of the class\".\n",
    "  *  For example, if you wanted to build a custom data-structure to describe \"animals\" for a biology project.\n",
    "     *  Then you could create a python class called \"animal\" to store information about the different animals in the study. \n",
    "     *  This class would be a \"**template**\" for define objects (see below) of the class \"animal\", for example\n",
